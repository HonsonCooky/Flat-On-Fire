## Pages

The pages' folder maintains a list of pages in the application. Each page has its own subfolder. Inside these
folders, you will find 'widgets' folder, which maintains a list of components (that are not full pages) for this
page. Common widgets (those used across more than one page) are held in the 'common' folder.
